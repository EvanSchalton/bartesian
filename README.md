# Bartesian

## Project Goal
- Create a package for decoding & encoding the bartesian barcodes
- Create a website (AWS Serverless & Angular) to allow users to create custom barcodes
- Model and provide STLs to create custom pods

## Setup
Recommend using `Docker`, `Visual Studio Code`, and the `Dev Containers` extension, that will ensure your environment is configured properly.

## Data Collection Support
- [Missing Data Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UmVmvDY4GTspve46AGPwY55gABCVB0fwfSsq5YPQAxE/edit?usp=sharing)

## Mentions
I was made aware of an earlier project by [branw](https://gist.github.com/branw/4e8db4fee95236d9e729631c7f0cdeff) where they also collected [pop data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xOaJ3-U09lUZ-JxVCGYNY6I0CPFFxbeZzURRTG68j6M/edit#gid=0) I haven't looked into the project yet, but it looks promising and will likely be able to be reused for the barcode decoding/encoding.
